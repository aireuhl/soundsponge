  <b>questioning</b>
<br><br>do sea sponges have ears?

<br><br>what relation(s) do we (as humans) share with the ocean and her residents?

  <b>reckoning</b>
<br><br>technlogy allows for representations of the humanly inaudible 
<br>on screens, with flashing lights, and via tactile vibration. 
<br><br>These sensorial interpretations of the external world inform and transmogrify how humans perceive nature.
<br><br>The persistant discovery of new methods that make attempts at understanding 
	  <br> our natural world often only “preserve” nature by taking it captive.
<br><br>Our constant (and persistant) monitoring permeates nature — 
	  <br>imposing human-centric desperation to transduce the unhearable into the realm of human perception.
<br><br>But how does a creature in its own space sense the sounds & silences around it, on <b>its</b> own terms?

  <b>practicing</b>
<br><br>using a zoom h4n pro recorder and a stereo hydrophone, we did our best to listen.  
<br><br>in trying to hear a world that is not fully ours, 
<br>we have collected, processed, reimagined, and displayed an experimental aural landscape of the sea.
<br><br>the late spring of two thousand and nineteen in southern california
	  <br>was met with the early arrival of june gloom and the migration of millions of  painted lady butterflies.
<br><br>we are certain that the sand crabs, sea hares, anemones, algae, kelp, barnacles, hermit  
	  <br>crabs, snails, isopods, and striped shore crabs that we encountered heard and
	  <br>* felt * a very different morning than we did on june eleventh. 
	  <br>but that morning, the waves and artifacts hitting the hydrophone made us feel (  even if just
	  <br>for a moment  ) just as small and connected to the sea as the creatures who call it home.
	  <br><br>we submerged ourselves.
	  <br>we swam out.
	  <br>we danced with kelp and tasted salt.
<br><br>we smiled through the post-production. 
<br>the beauty of many of our samples is their quiet, their low frequency, their “squips”, “pu-ip-ip-p-p“,
<br>“whisss”, and “thkthktikthks”. as a result of choosing p5.js and developing this page with a deadline,
<br>we were limited (although, we were limited to begin with and will remain limited). 
<br><br>we had to make decisions to increase volumes at times and decrease it at others, when the 
<br>mic recordings were too hot in order for our visualizations to be visible.</em>
